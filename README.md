# Springboro BPA 2022
BPA code for (435) Website Design Team of 2022

## Locations
For the time being I have stored all the html in the html folder, the css in the css folder, the images in the images folder, and the javascript in the Javascript. I haven't looked into react or bootstrap all that much but I think just html and css should be fine. Feel free to argue with me on this point, I also don't want to go through all the effort of testing responsive web pages.

## Branches
Make your edits in your own branches, I trust you can figure out how to make them. When you think your page or edits or whatever is ready to be added to the official page, submit a pull request to merge it with the master branch. Then we should be able to debate the changes and decide what is fully added. You can also just use the master branch at this point.

## Local download
Although you can just edit everything in the browser if you want, it's a lot easier to develop and test by cloning the repository to your local machine. If you're a gamer, run `git clone https://github.com/Xander-6085/SpringboroBPA2022.git` at the command line in the directory you want all the files in. When you want to send commits and push you can do that through the command line too. If you're cringe you can download a zip file of the repository with the green code button in the top right of the repository page. Edit whatever files you want to edit and then reupload them through the browser. I'm no expert on this since I just use command line and Android Studio all the time. Once you've got all the files locally downloaded, you can use whatever code editor you want to make the changes. Some of them, like Android Studio and Visual Studio have options to push to the git repository as well. Up to you if you want to mess with that.

## Testing
If you want to actually see how the website looks and your changes, it's pretty easy if you have it locally downloaded. Just open the file. If you didn't locally download it (looking at you Tommy), you should probably download the zip, extract it, and look at the files. Xander has cool link https://xander-6085.github.io/SpringboroBPA2022/. It just takes a few minutes to update.

## Final Thoughts
The instructions are on the home directory, I believe our submit date is the 11th, so we should finish it on Monday.
