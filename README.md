# Springboro BPA 2022
BPA code for (435) Website Design Team of 2022

## Locations
For the time being I have stored all the html in this main directory, the css in the css folder, and the images in the images folder. I haven't looked into react or bootstrap all that much but I think just html and css should be fine. Feel free to argue with me on this point, I also don't want to go through all the effort of testing responsive web pages.

## Branches
Make your edits in your own branches, I trust you can figure out how to make them. When you think your page or edits or whatever is ready to be added to the official page, submit a pull request to merge it with the master branch. Then we should be able to debate the changes and decide what is fully added.

## Final Thoughts
Apparently this is due January 7th, I'm not sure though and it's not like Mr. Clouse knows. Whenever I get my hands on the official instructions I'll put it up on the home directory.
