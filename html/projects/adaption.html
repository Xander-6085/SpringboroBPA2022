    	<h1>Fundraising for initiatives across the globe</h1>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The Adaptation Fund was developed to start climate change projects across the globe. The fund has been allocated over 850 million USD since 2010 and has started over 123 projects. Their outreach includes over 100 countries worldwide. The fund is financed by government and private donors. The fund started Direct Access which is a way for countries to receive funding for projects through national entities.
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;One of the Adaptation Fund’s projects is an expansion of a water waste facility in Jordan. With global warming increasing the temperature, water can start to become scarce for environments in which Jordan has. This project’s goal is to better develop a system for water reuse and implement that system agriculturally. This reused water could be used for fodder production to feed sheep or for endangered plants that are grown on farms.
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another project is to help decrease the amount and intensity of flooding from the Drin River Basin which affects countries from Kosovo to Greece. Torrential rain as a result of climate change has increased the amount of flooding going on in this region. This flooding has now started to affect human life in the region and economies. The project will therefore help countries affected by the flooding create a river basin flood management system with regional, national, and local levels to help protect vulnerable populations. This flood risk management system or FRM will be based on previous climate change data and will include a framework on how to alleviate and prevent damage caused by flooding.
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;Lastly, there is a project by the Adaptation Fund to help deal with Southern Africa’s increasing urbanization and lack of buildings suitable for climate change. With Southern Africa recently experiencing more natural hazards like flooding and cyclones, their urban areas need to be better equipped to handle them as climate change expands. That’s why this project will work with various levels of governments in countries affected to help develop more adequate conditions for dealing with such extreme weather. The project will then increase sharing of knowledge between the countries to better learn how to deal with climate change in this region of Africa.
