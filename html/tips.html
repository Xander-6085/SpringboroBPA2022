			<h2>Simple, everyday, choices that can reduce your carbon footprint</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Take cold showers</li>
					<p>Stop being a beta and man up for once. Not only will your shower be a lot shorter, less energy will be used to heat up the water.</p>
				<li>Eat more meat</li>
					<p>Cows and other animals produce methane, a gas that makes up about 10% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. By eating more meat you are actively working to reduce the U.S.'s national emissions, one steak at a time.</p>
				<li>Get some exercise</li>
					<p>Vehicles produce about 1/3rd of all of America's air pollution. By walking or biking everywhere not only are you saving the Earth, but also yourself from cardiovascular disease.</p>
				<li>Go hunting on reservations</li>
					<p>Contrary to popular belief, there is no good reason to keep species from extinction. Death and rebirth are natural parts of the circle of life. Our physical forms have no meaning besides the souls they contain. By participating in these animals' liberation from flesh, you help to reduce all the energy and resources they use up.</p>
				<li>Stop consuming products</li>
					<p>You do not need to see the 378th Soyderman movie, eat fatty foods filled with poison, nor drink sugary energy drinks. Any non-local business is contributing plenty more pollution than you ever would, and most of the pollution you generate is from supporting their archaic business practices. Go outside, touch grass.</p>
				<li>Create your own sources of energy</li>
					<p>If an 18 year old boy scout can build a nuclear reactor, so can you. Not only does this help solve our issues with fossil fuels and oil, it helps build independence for your community from the Middle Eastern oil markets.</p>
