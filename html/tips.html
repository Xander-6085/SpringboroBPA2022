        <!--<h2>Simple, everyday, choices that can reduce your carbon footprint</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Take cold showers</li>
            <p>Stop being a beta and man up for once. Not only will your shower be a lot shorter, less energy will be used to heat up the water.</p>
            <li>Eat more meat</li>
            <p>Cows and other animals produce methane, a gas that makes up about 10% of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. By eating more meat you are actively working to reduce the U.S.'s national emissions, one steak at a time.</p>
            <li>Get some exercise</li>
            <p>Vehicles produce about 1/3rd of all of America's air pollution. By walking or biking everywhere not only are you saving the Earth, but also yourself from cardiovascular disease.</p>
            <li>Go hunting on reservations</li>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, there is no good reason to keep species from extinction. Death and rebirth are natural parts of the circle of life. Our physical forms have no meaning besides the souls they contain. By participating in these animals'
                liberation from flesh, you help to reduce all the energy and resources they use up.</p>
            <li>Stop consuming products</li>
            <p>You do not need to see the 378th Soyderman movie, eat fatty foods filled with poison, nor drink sugary energy drinks. Any non-local business is contributing plenty more pollution than you ever would, and most of the pollution you generate
                is from supporting their archaic business practices. Go outside, touch grass.</p>
            <li>Create your own sources of energy</li>
            <p>If an 18 year old boy scout can build a nuclear reactor, so can you. Not only does this help solve our issues with fossil fuels and oil, it helps build independence for your community from the Middle Eastern oil markets.</p>
        </ol>-->

        <h2>Transportation Advice</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Drive Less</li>
            <p>Automobiles produce roughly 1/3rd of America's carbon emissions. By using alternative modes of transport, such as walking, biking, or public transportation, you greatly reduce your carbon footprint. Whenever you want to travel somewhere that
                would be too far without a car, you should consider carpooling or even reconsider going at all. The more you support local businesses the better!</p>
            <li>Accelerate and Brake only when Necessary</li>
            <p>Cars produce a lot more emissions when they are forced to use their engine more, and frequently hitting the gas or brake pedals runs the engine much faster than standard driving. Consider accelerating only gradually, and letting your car roll
                to a stop. Not only will this reduce your gas usage, it will also make your rides a whole lot smoother.</p>
            <li>Fly Less</li>
            <p>Planes are notorious for producing plenty of carbon emissions that are dangerous to the environment. Even with their large passenger capacity they still pollute much more than cars. By flying only when necessary, you help avoid high travel
                costs, and the Earth's destruction.</p>
	    <li>Plan Shorter Routes</li>
	    <p>Before leaving, always check your route to make sure it is the quickest available. Just a few minutes shorter can add up over long periods of time, and you can arrive at your destination faster.</p>
        </ol>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 5vh;">Home Advice</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Take Shorter, Colder Showers</li>
            <p>Of all of our daily appliances, showers use up the most water. To reduce this damage, take shorter showers. The less time you are in the shower, the less water will be used, and the less water that needs to be heated. A large portion of the
                electricity that we use comes from heating up water for our sinks and showers. Taking cold showers practically eliminates this extra energy usage, and can save you money on your monthly bills.</p>
            <li>Eat Local</li>
            <p>Many of our carbon emissions are not directly produced by us, but are from the companies that produce the food we buy. By eating food produced locally, you can greatly reduce the emissions produced by your food's creation. While most mega-corporations
                produce their products with massive, inhumane, and disgusting animal factories, local farms typically use old-fashioned methods that don't use as much fertilizer or pesticides. Also eating local helps inspire business in your community
                and helps your neighbors.</p>
            <li>Turn Off Appliances not in Use</li>
            <p>By being economical with what electricity you use, you can both reduce your electricity bill and decrease the amount of fossil fuels used to generate our power. When not in a room, turn the lights off. If you are very serious about decreasing
                your environmental impact, you could even live from sun up to sun down to not use lights whatsoever. Other appliances tend to use a lot of electricity as well, such as the dishwasher, oven, microwave, computer, and telephone. Make sure
                you don't accidentally leave one of these on, as they can suck up your power very quickly.</p>
	    <li>Let Sunlight In</li>
	    <p>By opening windows, curtains, and drapes, you can use a lot less energy with your home's lightbulbs. In addition, consider replacing your incandescent light bulbs with compact fuorescent light bulbs (CFLs). These bulbs are much more economical, use less energy, and last longer. If you live in urban areas and need privacy, consider buying special curtains that allow sunlight in but still block visible light.</p>
        </ol>
	
	<h2 style="margin-top: 5vh;">Technology Advice</h2>
	<hr>
	<ol>
	     <li>Store Data Locally</li>
	     <p>As you can imagine, massive datacenters make the mass majority of technology-related carbon emissions. The main way common people use these datacenters is through cloud storage. Common programs such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Youtube, and GitHub store your data in their servers, which not only uses a lot more power but also reduces your right to your own data.</p>
	     <li>Remove Unused Chargers</li>
	     <p>Whenever your devices are finished charging, remove the charger from the outlet. Although it isn't actively draining energy to charge things, residual energy is still lost due to inefficent cable design. A suprising amount of energy is lost to heat by unused chargers.</p>
	     <li>Turn off your Computer and Router</li>
	     <p>During periods of inactivity, shut down your computer and router. Especially at night, computers and routers are not commonly used and yet they still consume just as much power as if they are on during the day. You can even set times for your personal computer to turn itself off if you forget.</p>
	</ol>
	
	<h2 style="margin-top: 5vh;">Consumption Advice</h2>
	<hr>
	<ol>
	    <li>Purchase Second Hand Clothing</li>
	    <p>Clothing is typically produced in massive Chinese or African factories that both use child labor and plenty of energy. Buying clothes made locally or clothes already used reduces the amount of money you give to these operations and somewhat helps shut them down. Also, many of the materials used to make clothing are not recyclable or at least hard to reuse, so buying already worn clothing can reduce landfill waste.</p>
	    <li>Use Reusable Bags</li>
	    <p>Paper and plastic bags have been notorious for their negative impact on our carbon emissions over the past 50 years. Not to mention plastic bags make up a lot of the trash in landfills, the ocean, and our streets. Using reusable bags is a good alternative that is fairly cheap, more reliable, and stylish.</p>
